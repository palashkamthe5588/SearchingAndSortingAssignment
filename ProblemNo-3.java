A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.
Given a 0-indexed integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.
You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -∞. In other words, an element is always considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the array.
You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2.

Soln: 

  public class FindPeakElement {
    public int findPeakElement(int[] nums) {
        int left = 0;
        int right = nums.length - 1;

        while (left < right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;

            if (nums[mid] < nums[mid + 1]) {
                left = mid + 1;
            } else {
                right = mid;
            }
        }

        return left;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] nums = {1, 2, 3, 1};
        FindPeakElement finder = new FindPeakElement();
        int peakIndex = finder.findPeakElement(nums);
        System.out.println("Output: " + peakIndex);
    }
}
